# Aether, Earth, & Art

This is a simple website for the incredible people of Lamu Island, Kenya.

You can find the technical guts [here](https://github.com/andytudhope/earthart). This project is simply to render the frontend beautifully after our other friends at Bonfire shut up shop.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
